* Truth Discovery
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Problem:
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Information is available from multiple sources
   - It is inconsistent across various sources
 - Intuition:
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Information from a reliable source is more trustworthy
   - Source that provides trustworthy information is more reliable
 - Objectives:
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Evaluate reliability of data sources
   - Find the most trustworthy piece of information from most reliable source
* Notations
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Let $\mathcal{N}$ be the set of entities.
- Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the set of sources.
- Let $x_n^s$ be the information for an entity $n \in \mathcal{N}$ from a source $s \in \mathcal{S}$.
- Let $\mathcal{C} = \bigcup_{n \in \mathcal{N}, s \in \mathcal{S}}{(n,s,x_n^s)}$ be the set of claims as input, where each claim is a triple of entity, source, and information.
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Let $\mathcal{N}_s$ be the set of entities provided by source $s$.
- Let $\mathcal{S}_n$ be the set of sources that provide a claim on entity $n$.
- Let $x_n^*$ be the truth for an entity $n \in \mathcal{N}$, that is the most trustworthy piece of information $x_n^s$ for $s \in \mathcal{S}_n$.
- Let $\mathcal{X} = \bigcup_{n \in \mathcal{N}}{(n,x_n^*)}$ be the set of truths as output, where each truth is a couple of entity, and truth.
* Simple Voting Algorithm
[[./img/simple_voting_algo.png]]
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Assumptions: "majority" represents the "truth"
- Drawbacks: Cannot characterise reliability levels of sources
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Faulty sensors that keep emanating erroneous information
  - Spam users who propagate false information on the Web
- Corrections:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Simultaneously derive trustworthy facts and estimate source reliability degrees
  - For continuous claims, replace simple average with weighted average
  - For discreet claims, replace simple counts with weighted counts
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Additional Notations:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Let $\mathcal{W} = \bigcup_{s \in \mathcal{S}}{w_s}$ be the set of weights for each source
* Weighted Voting Algorithm

[[./img/eval_weights.png]]
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Assumptions:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - "truth" summarises all information weighted by reliability of each source
  - The reliability of a source is proportional to the probability of the source giving trustworthy information.
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - The probability is approximated by the percentage of correct claims.
- Drawbacks: Claims made by sources exhibits long-tail phenomenon.
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Most sources only provide information about one or two entities.
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - The probability of correct claim cannot be well-approxmiated if a source only has very few claims.
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Corrections:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Remove sources that provide only a few claims.
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - Threshold below which to remove a source needs to be defined.
    - May result in very sparse data and limited coverage.
  - Use Bayesian estimation with a smoothing prior
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - Needs to specify a prior
    - Curse of dimensionality
* Confidence-aware Approach
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Intuition:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Unreliable sources make errors frequently.
  - Unreliable sources have wide spectra of errors in distribution.
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Additional Notations:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Let $\epsilon_s$ be the error of a claim made by source $s$ from the truth.
  - Let $\sigma_s^2$ be the variance $\epsilon_s$.
  - Let $u_s^2$ be the upper bound of error variance $\sigma_s^2$.
* Confidence-Aware Truth Discovery
- Assumptions:
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Sources are consistent in the quality of its claims, so the truth is obtained from weighted average of claims
    $$x_n^*=\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}_n}{w_s \cdot x_n^s}$$
  - Claims are made independently across sources
    $$\epsilon_s \overset{i.n.i.d.}{\sim} \mathcal{F}$$
  - None of the sources deliberately make errors.
    $$\mathbb{E}(\epsilon_s)=0\ \forall s \in \mathcal{S}$$
  - Reliability of sources is reflected in the spread of their errors, and assume error is normally distributed.
    $$\epsilon_s \overset{i.n.i.d}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_s^2)\ \forall s \in \mathcal{S}$$
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Let $\epsilon=\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}{w_s \epsilon_s}$, it follows that
  $$\epsilon \sim N\Big(0,\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}{w_s^2 \sigma_s^2}\Big)$$
- The goal is to minimise $\epsilon$, i.e.
  \begin{array}{ll@{}ll}
  \min_{\{w_s\}} & \displaystyle\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}} w_s^2 \sigma_s^2 &\\
  \text{s.t.}      & \displaystyle\sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} w_s = 1,  w_s \geq 0, \forall s \in \mathcal{S}\\
  \end{array}
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- The error variance is usuallyestimated by sample variance
  $$\hat{\sigma_s^2} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{N}_s|}\sum_{n \in \mathcal{N}_s} \Big(x_n^s - x_n^{*(0)} \Big)^2$$
- It follows that
  $$\frac{\sum_{n \in \mathcal{N}_s} \Big(x_n^s - x_n^{*(0)} \Big)^2}{\sigma_s^2}=\frac{|\mathcal{N}_s|\hat{\sigma_s^2}}{\sigma_s^2}\sim\chi^2(|\mathcal{N}_s|) $$
- For $\alpha$ significant level,
  $$P\Big(\chi^2_{(1-\alpha/2,|\mathcal{N}_s|)} < \frac{|\mathcal{N}_s|\hat{sigma_s^2}}{\sigma_s^2} < \chi^2_{(\alpha/2,|\mathcal{N}_s|)} \Big) = 1 - \alpha$$
- And the $1-\alpha$ confidence interval as
  $$\Big(\frac{\sum_{n \in \mathcal{N}_s}{(x_n^s - x_n^{*(0)})^2}}{\chi^2_{(1-\alpha/2,|\mathcal{N}_s|)}}, \frac{\sum_{n \in \mathcal{N}_s}{(x_n^s - x_n^{*(0)})^2}}{\chi^2_{(\alpha/2,|\mathcal{N}_s|)}}\Big)$$
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Use upper bound of $(1-\alpha)$ confidence interval, i.e. $u_s^2$, as an estimator for $\sigma_s^2$ instead
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - The intuition is to minimise the worst case error spread
  - It's a biased but consistent estimator
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- The closed form solution to the error optimisation is given as
  $$w_s \propto \frac{1}{u_s^2} = \frac{\chi^2_{(\alpha/2,|\mathcal{N}_s|)}}{\sum _{n\in\mathcal{N}_s}{\Big(x_n^s-x_n^{*(0)}\Big)^2}}$$
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Weights are proportional to the upper bound of $1-\alpha$ confidence interval for its real variance
  - For sources with small number of claims, the $\chi^2$ probability value dominates
  - For sources with larger number of claims, it converge to $|\mathcal{N}_s|$
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Algorithm:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Remove outliers, and initialise truths by mean or median for example.
  - Comput source weight
  - Compute truths
* Takeaway From Experiments
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- CATD tkaes the number of claims made by a source into consideration
  - Ceteris paribus, sources with fewer number of claims have low weights
  - This is desirable because it's only meaningful to estimate the reliability if a source makes sufficient claims
